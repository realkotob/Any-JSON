Godot 4.5 / 4.6 plugin to convert any Godot variant to raw JSON & back.

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/-gray?style=flat&logo=discord)](https://dsc.gg/sohp) **Version:** 3.0.0

</div>

# **Introduction**
This plugin can serialize pretty much any\* data type within Godot to a JSON-compatible dictionary. You can serialize entire objects or trees of objects while preserving all data.

Any-JSON is very simple to use, no need for setup or specification. All built-in classes should already be supported, but if you run into an object with an unsupported class you can simply add that class to the `A2J.object_registry` & try again. For finer control over how things get done, see [rulesets](#rulesets).

After converting your item to an AJSON dictionary, you can use `JSON.stringify` to turn it into a raw text string but you will need to convert it back to a dictionary using `JSON.parse_string` if you want to convert it back to the original item.

As of Godot 4.6 this is almost every `Variant.Type` available in GDScript that isn't run-time exclusive (like `RID`). If new types are added to GDScript you can add your own handler by extending `A2JTypeHandler` & adding an instance of the handler to `A2J.type_handlers`.

**Note:**
Packed array types are converted to a long hexadecimal string, so they will not be human readable.
The only exceptions are `PackedColorArray` (array of color hex codes), & `PackedStringArray` (array of strings).

Here are the types that will never be supported & their reasons:
- Signal: signals are too complex due to all the moving parts & references. On top of that, there is no use case that comes to mind where saving this to disk would be useful.
- RID: this type is exclusively used for run time resource identifiers & would not be useful to save, as stated in the GDScript documentation.

## Nesting all the way
All children of the item you are converting are recursively serialized. This means you can convert entire scene trees & every single resource it uses if you wanted to.

This is a big advantage over some other plugins.

Any-JSON also handles circular references, this means a property can link back to the original object but it will simply be converted to a reference instead of triggering infinite recursion.
This works by storing an index value (packed within ".type") for every *unique* object.

## Types preserved
Any-JSON automatically re-types values to the type of the property it is assigning to in an `Object`, meaning you can serialize objects with strict property types & still guarantee everything will be the correct type upon deserialization.

**There is one exception!** This system will fail to apply values to object properties that are typed with LOCAL custom classes. Example:
- Invalid:
  ```gdscript
  var property:CustomLocalClass

  class CustomLocalClass:
    # ...
  ```
- Valid:
  ```gdscript
  # example.gd
  var property:CustomGlobalClass
  # ...

  # global_class.gd
  class_name CustomGlobalClass
  # ...
  ```

Without automatic typing, Godot will fail to apply a standard `Array` value to a property of type `Array[int]`. The same applies to typed dictionaries & other typed values.

The way Any-JSON ensures type safety is very efficient & doesn't require saving type data. During deserialization property type data is pulled from the class & that is used to tell the value what type it should be.

## Modular
Everything is coded in GDScript across distinct classes & files, allowing for easy modification & extension.

## Editor-ready
Unlike the most common alternatives, Any-JSON can work in the editor so it can be used within other editor tools.
A downside to `ResourceSaver` is that the resource path, UID, & other meta data are saved when used in the editor. This was one of the main drives for me to make Any-JSON, as this would not be viable for some of my purposes.

## Error logs
Custom errors are printed to the console when serialization goes wrong. A generic unknown class error would look something like this `ERROR: A2JObjectTypeHandler.gd found error at ROOT > SomeProperty > @index:0: Class "MyCustomClass" is not defined in registry.`.

You can connect to the `A2J.error_server` to run code when an error occurs.
There are 2 signals emitted from `A2J.error_server`.
- `handler_error`: Emitted when any of the type handlers catch an error.
- `core_error`: Emitted when the core A2J process catches an error.


# Rulesets
A "ruleset" can be supplied when converting to or from AJSON allowing fine control over serialization. Something you don't get with `var_to_str` & not as much with `ResourceSaver`.

The layout of a ruleset is simple. Rules are set per-class. You can also use special keys that start with "@" to specify groups of rules that apply to things based on the key. For example the "\@global" group specifies rules that apply to every class.

Example:
```
{
  # This is where you can put rules that apply to EVERYTHING you serialize or deserialize.
  '@global': {
    # ...
  },
  # This is where you can put rules that only apply to nodes.
  'Node': {
    # ...
  },
  'MyCustomClass': {
    # ...
  },
}
```

## Special groups
### `@global`
Rules that apply everywhere.

### `@depth:<int>[+,-]`
Rules that only apply a certain tree depth. Use the `+` sign to have this group also affect all depths above the specified depth. Use the `-` sign to also affect depths below.

## Rule modifiers
You can add modifiers to the end of rule keys to affect it's behavior. Here is an example: `type_exclusions@des`.

### `@des`
The rule will only apply during deserialization (converting *from* an AJSON object).

### `@ser`
The rule will only apply during serialization (converting *to* an AJSON object).

## Basic rules
### `type_exclusions (Array[String])`
Variant types that will be discarded.

### `type_inclusions (Array[String])`
Variant types that are allowed, all other types will be discarded unless the list is left empty.

### `class_exclusions (Array[String])`
Object classes that will be discarded.

### `class_inclusions (Array[String])`
Object classes that are allowed, all other classes will be discarded unless the list is left empty.

### `property_exclusions (Array[String])`
Property names that will be discarded.

### `property_inclusions (Array[String])`
Property names that are allowed, all other properties will be discarded unless the list is left empty.

### `exclude_private_properties (bool=false)`
Exclude object properties that start with an underscore. Also affects object metadata properties.

### `exclude_default_values (bool=false)`:
Exclude object properties with values the same as the default of that property. This can be enabled to prevent saving unnecessary data.

### `snap_floats_to (float)`:
If passed, the value to snap float variables to (using `@GlobalScope.snappedf`).
This is useful to cut down on space if you have many float values that you do not need to be so precise.

## Advanced rules

### `automatic_resource_references (bool=false)`
Automatically convert external resource objects to references when serializing to AJSON. This will only affect resources available as it's own file.

### `property_references (Dictionary[String,String])`
Names of object properties that will be converted to a named reference (that doesn't store any actual data) when serializing to AJSON. The value of this property must be supplied during deserialization using the `property_reference_values` rule.

### `property_reference_values (Dictionary[String,Variant])`
Variants to replace named references with during deserialization.

### `instantiator_arguments (Dictionary[String,Array])`
Arguments that will be passed to the class' `new` method where the class name is the dictionary key & the arguments are the dictionary value. Should be used under global rule group.

### `instantiator_function (Callable(registered_object:Object, object_class:String, args:Array=[]) -> Object)`
 Used for implementing custom logic for object instantiation. Useful for changing values after instantiation. The returned object will be used to compare default values when converting to AJSON, & will be used as a base when converting from AJSON.

 Does not make a difference which rule group this rule is used under.

### `midpoint (Callable(item:Variant, ruleset:Dictionary) -> bool)`
Called right before serializing a variant. Returning `true` will permit the variant to be passed on, returning `false` will discard the variant (passing `null` instead).


# Preserving data integrity
Here are a few rules you should follow so that you don't risk losing any data during or after serialization.
- **Don't modify object indices:** Any-JSON uses index numbers to identify unique objects in resulting AJSON. These are necessary for resolving references & tampering with the indices will lead to incorrect deserialization of those references.
- **Don't modify property defaults:** (Only applies if you use `exclude_properties_set_to_default` rule) Don't modify the default values of properties in classes that are used in serialization.
- **Be aware of script dependencies:** Properties dependent on the original object's script in AJSON will be lost unless the script property is present in the AJSON (as a reference or an actual script object).
- **Version mismatching:** Never use AJSON data produced from outdated versions of Any-JSON. Always use the same version to deserialize as you used to originally serialize that data. However, minor versions should still be cross compatible (X.X.*).

# Editing the object registry
In Any-JSON the object registry is a collection of classes & their names. This is required for the plugin to find & access the class methods. You may need to edit the object registry if you have custom classes or if there are built-in classes that you have removed from the engine.

The simpliest way to do this is via code in your project.
```gdscript
A2J.object_registry.set('my_custom_class', my_custom_class)
```
However with this method it is only effective for *adding* to the registry. If you need to remove classes that are no longer available or that you have explicitly removed from your engine, then you have 2 options.
1. Manually find & remove the class(es) from `object_registry` in `A2J.gd` in the plugin's folder.
2. Use the registry generator tool included in the repo to replace the value of `object_registry`.

I recommend including only the classes that you *know* you will be passing through Any-JSON. The default object registry includes nearly every built-in instantiable class in Godot, but that is only for the convenience of new or one-time users. In reality you will never need all of those classes.

## Using the registry generator
To use this tool, make sure you have the entire repo downloaded & open inside Godot. Now open the registry generator scene & select the top node, you should see a "Generate" button in the inspector dock.

Clicking "Generate" will output the new registry in the `output_path` defined in the inspector. There are 2 main settings you need to know about:
- `engine_compilation_configuration`: GDBuild file to use for deciding which classes to include in the generated registry. This can also use "disabled_build_options" to decide classes to exclude.
- `more_disabled_classes`: Classes to exclude in the generated registry.

# Example usage
## Adding to object registry
Simply add the name of the class & the class itself to the `A2J.object_registry` dictionary. Do not add an instance of the object to the registry.
```gdscript
class custom_class_1:
  var some_value:bool = true


class custom_class_2:
  var some_value:int = 1


A2J.object_registry.merge({
  'custom_class_1': custom_class_1,
  'custom_class_2': custom_class_2,
})


# With constructor.
# -----------------

class custom_class_3:
  var some_value: int

  func _init(some_value:int) -> void:
  		self.some_value = some_value


# Add as normal.
A2J.object_registry.merge({
  'custom_class_3': custom_class_3,
})


# Add instantiator arguments for "custom_class_3".
var ruleset := {
  '@global': {
	'instantiator_arguments': {
  	'custom_class_3': [100], # With this, "custom_class_3" will be instantiated with the first argument in it's constructor as "100".
	},
  },
}
```
In this case, we are using the `merge` method on the object registry to add multiple objects while preserving all the default ones.

## Serializing to AJSON
Just pass the item you want to serialize to the `A2J.to_json` method. You can provide a custom ruleset, otherwise it will use the default ruleset defined at `A2J.default_ruleset_to`.
```gdscript
var literally_any_thing := Vector3(1,2,3)
var result = A2J.to_json(literally_any_thing)
if result == null:
  print('something went wrong')
else:
  print(result)


# With custom ruleset.
# --------------------

class custom_class:
  var_1:int = 1
  var_2:float = 0.5

var ruleset := {
  # Excludes the "var_1" property for "custom_class".
  'custom_class': {
	'property_exclusions': [
	  'var_1',
	],
  },
}

A2J.object_registry.set('custom_class', custom_class)
result = A2J.to_json(custom_class.new(), ruleset)
if result == null:
  print('something went wrong')
else:
  print(result)
```

## Serializing back from AJSON
Just pass the item you want to serialize to the `A2J.from_json` method. You can provide a custom ruleset, otherwise it will use the default ruleset defined at `A2J.default_ruleset_from`.
```gdscript
var ajson = A2J.to_json(Vector3(1,2,3))
var result = A2J.from_json(ajson)
print(result) # Prints "(1, 2, 3)".
print(type_string(typeof(result))) # Prints "Vector3".
```

## Safe deserialization
This is how you can deserialize AJSON data without the risk of running external code.
```gdscript
var ruleset := {
  '@global': {
	'class_exclusions@des': [
  	'GDScript',
	],
  },
}

var result = A2J.from_json(your_serialized_object, ruleset)
```
In this example we utilize the "class\_exclusions" rule (with [@des](#des) modifier) to exclude any object with the class name "GDScript during deserialization. Any instances of a GDScript object in the AJSON will be discarded during conversion back to an object.

However if your object is like a node with a script attached, you cannot exclude the script otherwise script dependent variables will be lost. You should **reference** the script instead excluding it see [rulesets -> advanced rules](#rulesets).

If you have any other classes in the `A2J.object_registry` that can execute arbitrary code, you may want to add them to the list of exclusions.
